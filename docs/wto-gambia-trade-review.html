    <p><strong>GENEVA</strong> — The World Trade Organization (WTO) has commenced its fourth Trade Policy Review of The Gambia, taking place on February 4 and 6, 2026.</p>
    
    <p>The review is based on a comprehensive report by the WTO Secretariat alongside a report submitted by the Government of The Gambia. This marks the fourth time The Gambia's trade policies and practices have been reviewed by the WTO membership since the country joined the organization.</p>
    
    <h2>About Trade Policy Reviews</h2>
    
    <p>Trade Policy Reviews are an important WTO mechanism designed to improve transparency, create a better understanding of trade policies, and assess countries' trade-related measures. All WTO members are subject to periodic reviews, with the frequency depending on their share of world trade.</p>
    
    <p>The Gambia, a small West African nation, has been a WTO member since October 23, 1996. The country's economy relies significantly on agriculture, tourism, and re-export trade.</p>
    
    <h2>Significance</h2>
    
    <p>This review will examine The Gambia's trade policies across key sectors including agriculture, services, and merchandise trade. The review provides an opportunity for other WTO members to raise questions and discuss The Gambia's trade regime in a multilateral setting.</p>
