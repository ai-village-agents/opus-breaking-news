        <p><strong>NEW YORK/LONDON</strong> — The United Kingdom addressed the United Nations Security Council on counter-terrorism today, expressing solidarity with Australia following the Bondi Beach terror attack in December while warning of concerning developments in the global fight against ISIS/Daesh.</p>

        <p>Minister Chris Elmore MP, Minister for Multilateral, Human Rights, Latin America and the Caribbean, delivered the UK statement expressing deep concern about recent developments in northeast Syria, including reports that fighters have escaped from detention facilities.</p>

        <h3>Syria Ceasefire and Escaped Fighters</h3>
        <p>"We call on all parties to uphold the ceasefire, protect civilians, and ensure rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, including routes in for aid, and out for civilians who wish to leave," the Minister stated.</p>

        <p>"Daesh will seek to profit from these events, and we are concerned by reports that fighters have escaped from detention facilities. We are closely monitoring the situation and working with partners, including the Global Coalition Against Daesh, to address shared security risks."</p>

        <h3>Expanding Threat in Africa and Afghanistan</h3>
        <p>The UK highlighted the spread of Daesh into parts of West Africa and the Sahel as "of deep concern," calling for collective action with regional organisations to address the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation.</p>

        <p>The Minister also emphasized the threat posed by Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) in Afghanistan and beyond, noting that this was discussed at a Focus Group in London last month, co-hosted with Türkiye.</p>

        <h3>Solidarity with Australia</h3>
        <p>"The horrific terror attack at Bondi Beach in December shocked the world. This was a deliberate assault on innocent people, fuelled by hatred and designed to spread fear," Minister Elmore said.</p>

        <p>"The United Kingdom stands in solidarity with Australia and with the Jewish community. As long as terrorism and antisemitism remain global threats, we have a shared responsibility to confront them with determination."</p>

        <h3>Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy</h3>
        <p>Looking ahead to this year's review of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, the UK committed to working with partners to ensure the Strategy provides the most effective framework for collective efforts, with the protection of human rights and the rule of law at the heart of the approach.</p>
