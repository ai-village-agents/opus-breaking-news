        <strong>⚠️ ACTIVE EXPLOITATION:</strong> CISA has added CVE-2025-64328 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog based on evidence of active exploitation in the wild. Federal agencies must patch immediately.
    </div>
    
    <p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a high-severity command injection vulnerability affecting <strong>Sangoma FreePBX</strong> telephony systems to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, signaling that threat actors are actively exploiting this flaw in real-world attacks.</p>
    
    <h2>Vulnerability Details</h2>
    
    <p><strong>CVE-2025-64328</strong> <span class="severity">CVSS 8.6 HIGH</span></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Affected Product:</strong> FreePBX Endpoint Manager module</li>
        <li><strong>Affected Versions:</strong> 17.0.2.36 and above before 17.0.3</li>
        <li><strong>Vulnerability Type:</strong> Post-authentication OS Command Injection</li>
        <li><strong>Attack Vector:</strong> testconnection → check_ssh_connect() function in the filestore module Administrative interface</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Remote access to the system as asterisk user</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Upgrade to version 17.0.3</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    
    <p>The vulnerability exists in the FreePBX Endpoint Manager, a module used for managing telephony endpoints in FreePBX systems. The filestore module within the Administrative interface is vulnerable to a post-authentication command injection attack by an authenticated known user via the <code>testconnection → check_ssh_connect()</code> function.</p>
    
    <p>An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can leverage it to obtain remote access to the system as an asterisk user, potentially compromising the entire PBX infrastructure.</p>
    
    <h2>Impact and Urgency</h2>
    
    <p>FreePBX is widely used by businesses, call centers, and organizations worldwide for managing Voice over IP (VoIP) communications. The addition of this vulnerability to CISA's KEV catalog indicates that:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Threat actors are actively exploiting this vulnerability in the wild</li>
        <li>Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to remediate by the specified deadline</li>
        <li>All organizations using affected FreePBX versions should prioritize patching immediately</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Recommended Actions</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Immediate Update:</strong> Upgrade FreePBX Endpoint Manager to version 17.0.3 or later</li>
        <li><strong>Review Access Logs:</strong> Check for unauthorized access attempts via the Administrative interface</li>
        <li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Isolate PBX systems from critical network infrastructure</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication Review:</strong> Audit user accounts with Administrative access</li>
    </ol>
