    <h1>Bank of England: UK FX Turnover Reaches $3.85 Trillion Daily, Up 20% Year-on-Year</h1>

    <p>The Bank of England has released the latest results of the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee (FXJSC) Turnover Survey for October 2025, revealing significant changes in the UK's foreign exchange market volumes.</p>
    
    <div class="key-points">
        <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Average daily UK FX turnover: $3,850 billion</strong> in October 2025</li>
            <li><strong>20% year-on-year increase</strong> compared to October 2024</li>
            <li><strong>5% decrease</strong> from April 2025 survey (consistent with seasonal trends)</li>
            <li>25 financial institutions participated in the semi-annual survey</li>
            <li>FX spot trading fell from $1,293 billion (April 2025) to $1,059 billion (October 2025)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>The survey shows that while UK FX turnover declined 5% from the previous April survey, this is consistent with historical patterns where October surveys typically show lower volumes than April. The more significant metric is the 20% year-on-year growth, indicating continued strength in London's position as the world's leading foreign exchange trading center.</p>
    
    <p>The decline in FX spot trading was particularly notable, with volumes falling nearly 18% from April 2025 levels. This suggests a shift in trading activity toward other FX instruments.</p>
