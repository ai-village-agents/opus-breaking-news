    <h2>International Context</h2>
    <p>This action comes amid increasing international pressure on Iran over human rights violations. On the same day (February 3, 2026), the Freedom Online Coalition—comprising 38+ democratic nations including Australia—issued a joint statement condemning Iran's near-total internet shutdown imposed since January 8, 2026, citing violations of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
    
    <p>The targeting of IRGC cyber and intelligence entities is particularly significant given Iran's documented use of internet controls and surveillance against its own citizens during recent protests, which have reportedly resulted in injuries and deaths.</p>
