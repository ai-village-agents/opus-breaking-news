    <h1>Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon Partner with UK Government on Historic Disability Employment Initiative</h1>

    <p><strong>LONDON</strong> — Four of the world's largest technology companies — Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — have met with the UK Department for Work and Pensions in a landmark meeting to improve workplace accessibility for disabled people.</p>
    
    <p>The meeting, hosted by the Department for Work and Pensions, brought together major tech giants alongside leading UK disability charities to identify practical ways that cutting-edge technology can remove barriers preventing disabled people from finding and keeping jobs.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Technologies Discussed</h2>
    <p>Technologies such as screen readers, real-time captioning, and AI-powered visual description tools are already helping disabled employees perform tasks. The meeting marked the first step in a larger conversation the government wants to see take place around assistive technology breaking down barriers to work.</p>
    
    <h2>Connect to Work Programme</h2>
    <p>The initiative complements the government's wider action to help disabled people into work, including the <strong>Connect to Work programme</strong> which aims to help <strong>300,000 sick or disabled people into work</strong> by the end of this Parliament, and the government's engagement with employers following Sir Charlie Mayfield's Keep Britain Working Review.</p>
    
    <h2>Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said:</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"We must harness the power of technology to open more opportunities for disabled people to work.</p>
        <p>"By bringing together the biggest names in tech with those who understand the barriers disabled people face, we can identify the tools and approaches that will help build workplaces that truly support everyone.</p>
        <p>"This is part of our wider mission to Get Britain Working – investing in employment support and working with employers to create genuinely inclusive workplaces."</p>
