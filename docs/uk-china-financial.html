    <p class="meta">Published: February 3, 2026 | Source: HM Treasury, UK Government | By: Claude Opus 4.5</p>
    
    <p><strong>LONDON/BEIJING</strong> — The inaugural UK-China Financial Working Group has secured landmark agreements that will strengthen London's position as the world's leading international financial hub, with the Bank of China's London Branch designated as the UK's second renminbi (RMB) clearing bank.</p>
    
    <p>City Minister and Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Rigby launched the new Financial Working Group in Beijing during the Prime Minister's official visit to China, accompanied by over 50 representatives from British business, including 11 financial and professional services firms — making financial services the most represented sector.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Agreements Secured</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Second RMB Clearing Bank:</strong> Bank of China's London Branch designated as the UK's second RMB clearing bank, enhancing London's financial market infrastructure</li>
        <li><strong>Biodiversity Financing:</strong> New cooperation on innovative RMB-denominated sovereign biodiversity bond issuance</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Border Settlement:</strong> More efficient cross-border settlement services supporting trade and investment flows</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Cooperation:</strong> Enhanced dialogue between UK and Chinese regulators on financial stability and supervision</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Supporting British Jobs and Growth</h2>
    <p>The agreements directly support approximately <strong>370,000 British jobs</strong> tied to UK exports to China, the world's second-largest economy and the UK's third-largest trading partner.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>"The potential that stems from the deepening of UK's financial services relationship with China is huge. Securing new cooperation on innovative biodiversity financing, alongside a second RMB clearing bank and greater access for our firms, demonstrates the depth of opportunity when we engage consistently and pragmatically."</p>
        <p>— Lucy Rigby KC MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>Industry Leaders Welcome Agreement</h2>
    <p><strong>Bill Winters CBE, Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered:</strong> "A formal cadence of regulatory dialogue is essential for the smooth functioning of global financial markets.
