    <p><strong>LONDON</strong> — The Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have announced the first cohort of banks and building societies selected for their joint Scale-up Unit, a new regulatory initiative designed to support fast-growing financial institutions.</p>
    
    <p>The six firms accepted into the inaugural cohort are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Allica Bank</strong> — SME-focused challenger bank</li>
        <li><strong>ClearBank</strong> — Clearing and embedded banking infrastructure</li>
        <li><strong>Monument Bank</strong> — Premium banking for high-net-worth clients</li>
        <li><strong>Nottingham Building Society</strong> — Established mutual building society</li>
        <li><strong>OakNorth Bank</strong> — Mid-market lending specialist</li>
        <li><strong>Zopa Bank</strong> — Consumer finance and savings platform</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>According to the announcement, these firms will receive tailored regulatory support as they "develop new products, attract new customers, and move into new markets." PRA and FCA officials will meet with the firms both individually and as a group throughout the coming months.</p>
    
    <p>The Scale-up Unit was originally announced last year as part of UK regulators' efforts to maintain the country's position as a leading fintech hub while ensuring appropriate oversight of rapidly growing financial institutions.</p>
