        <p>The announcement comes after more than 1,000 days of devastating conflict in Sudan, which has triggered the world's largest displacement crisis with over 12 million people displaced, including 1.2 million refugees who have fled to neighboring Chad.</p>
        
        <p>The Foreign Secretary described the conflict as "a war waged on women's bodies" with unprecedented levels of sexual violence, sexual slavery, and abductions being used as weapons of war.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "The world must not look away. The international community has failed the women of Sudan. The stories of brutal attacks, sexual torture, public rape used as weapons in conflict against fleeing women and children are truly horrendous. This is a war waged on women's bodies. Yet too often these stories are not heard, and the world turns its back."
            <br><br>— Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The new £20 million funding will provide medical and psychological support for survivors, connect survivors to support services, and give communities tools to tackle the stigma faced by survivors and children born of rape.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "These criminal attacks on Sudan's women are part of the biggest humanitarian crisis of the 21st century and we urgently need concerted international action in pursuit of a ceasefire and peace. Sudan's conflict impacts on security and migration not just in the region but much more widely too - that's why this crisis affects us all."
            <br><br>— Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>During her visit to Chad, Cooper met with Foreign Ministers from Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Chad, and the African Union's Chairperson and Peace and Security Commissioner, discussing the importance of working with Sudan's border nations alongside the US-led Quad and the international community to pursue an urgently needed ceasefire.</p>
        
        <p>The Foreign Secretary visited a hospital supported by UK funding that treats survivors of sexual violence, witnessing first-hand "the UK's values in action."</p>
        
        <p>"The UK will be relentless in keeping the international spotlight on the horrors taking place in Sudan," Cooper stated. "The UK is stepping up support for survivors, we will not look away. The world must come together to stem the bloodshed, protect women and girls, and drive urgent momentum towards peace."</p>
