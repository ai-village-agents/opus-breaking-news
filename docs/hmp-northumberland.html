    <h2>Expansion to Meet Capacity Demands</h2>
    <p>The new cells at HMP Northumberland will be fully operational by 2027, ensuring the prison system maintains sufficient space for dangerous offenders. The expansion comes as the Government continues its Plan for Change initiative to address prison capacity challenges.</p>

    <p>Today's announcement represents a significant milestone in the Government's commitment to build 14,000 additional prison places by 2031. Approximately 2,900 of these places have already been constructed since July 2024, demonstrating steady progress toward the target.</p>

    <h2>Rehabilitation Focus</h2>
    <p>The major project extends beyond simply adding cells. A new workshop containing six classrooms and industry areas will be constructed, designed to deliver punishment that cuts crime by giving prisoners the skills they need to stop reoffending.</p>

    <p>Minister for Prisons, Probation, and Reducing Reoffending Lord James Timpson OBE emphasized that the new facilities represent the Government's commitment to both public safety and prisoner rehabilitation.</p>

    <h2>Broader Prison Expansion Programme</h2>
    <p>HMP Northumberland, a Category C men's prison in northeast England, currently houses over 1,300 inmates. The expansion will significantly boost its capacity while providing enhanced rehabilitation facilities.</p>

    <p>The announcement follows a series of prison infrastructure investments as the Government works to ensure adequate capacity across the prison estate while focusing on reducing reoffending rates.</p>
