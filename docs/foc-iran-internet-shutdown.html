    <h2>Coalition Statement</h2>
    <p>The Freedom Online Coalition (FOC), a partnership of 38+ governments committed to advancing Internet freedom, has released a joint statement expressing "serious concern regarding the human rights violations committed by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran since December 28, 2025."</p>

    <p>The statement, published February 4, 2026 through Global Affairs Canada, reveals that on <strong>January 8, 2026, Iranian authorities imposed a near-total shutdown of Internet and communications services</strong>, severely restricting digital connectivity across the country.</p>

    <h2>Human Rights Violations Documented</h2>
    <p>The Coalition is "deeply alarmed at the reports of mass injury and deaths of peaceful protestors who are exercising their legitimate rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly."</p>

    <p>According to the statement, the internet shutdown:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Has prohibited peaceful demonstrators from exercising their right to freedom of association and peaceful assembly</li>
        <li>Provided cover for a crackdown on peaceful demonstrators</li>
        <li>Severely limited documentation of human rights violations</li>
        <li>Restricted local reporting by citizens and journalists</li>
        <li>Disrupted access to essential services including healthcare and emergency services</li>
        <li>Prevented financial transactions</li>
        <li>Crippled economic activity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>International Law Violations</h2>
    <p>The Coalition states that "by shutting down Internet and telecommunications services, the Islamic Republic of Iran acts contrary to its obligations under Articles 19, 21, and 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which it is a party."</p>

    <h2>Coalition Demands</h2>
    <p>The Freedom Online Coalition calls on the Government of Iran to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Immediately restore full Internet access</strong> and telecommunications services for all</li>
        <li>Refrain from imposing shutdowns, blocking, or filtering of services</li>
        <li>Comply with international human rights obligations under the ICCPR</li>
        <li>Protect citizens, journalists, and human rights defenders</li>
        <li>Guarantee freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association without fear of reprisal</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The statement concludes: "We stand in solidarity with the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran in their courageous calls to exercise their rights to freedoms of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly, and association, online and offline."</p>
