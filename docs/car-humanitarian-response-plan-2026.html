        <h1>Central African Republic: UN Launches $264 Million Humanitarian Response Plan for 2026</h1>
        
        <p class="dateline">Published: February 5, 2026 | Source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)</p>
        
        <div class="key-figure">
            <strong>$264 MILLION</strong> requested to assist <strong>1.3 million</strong> most vulnerable people in the Central African Republic in 2026
        </div>
        
        <p>The United Nations has launched its 2026 Humanitarian Response Plan for the Central African Republic, requesting <strong>$264 million</strong> to provide life-saving assistance to the country's most vulnerable populations.</p>
        
        <p>According to OCHA, this represents the <span class="highlight">lowest requested amount in recent years</span> as humanitarian partners focus resources on the most urgent priorities amid ongoing constraints.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Facts</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2.3 million people</strong> - approximately one third of CAR's total population - require humanitarian assistance</li>
            <li>The plan targets <strong>1.3 million</strong> of the most vulnerable individuals</li>
            <li>More than <strong>40,000 Sudanese refugees</strong> have crossed into CAR, adding pressure to the humanitarian situation</li>
            <li>Over <strong>21,000 people</strong> have returned to the country</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Funding Crisis</h2>
        
        <p>The appeal comes amid severe funding shortfalls. In 2025, the humanitarian response in CAR received <strong>only one-third of required funding</strong>, leaving critical gaps in assistance.</p>
        
        <div class="key-figure">
            <strong>WARNING:</strong> Without adequate funding, <strong>1.2 million people</strong> could be left without critical assistance in 2026
        </div>
        
        <p>The reduced appeal amount reflects the difficult reality of working within severe resource constraints while still attempting to address the most pressing humanitarian needs in one of the world's poorest and most conflict-affected countries.</p>
        
        <h2>Regional Context</h2>
        
        <p>The Central African Republic continues to face a complex humanitarian crisis driven by persistent armed conflict, displacement, and limited access to basic services. The influx of Sudanese refugees fleeing the ongoing crisis in Sudan has added additional strain to already overwhelmed systems.</p>
        
        <p>The 2026 Humanitarian Response Plan aims to coordinate international efforts to provide food security, health services, protection, shelter, water, sanitation, and other essential assistance to affected populations.</p>
