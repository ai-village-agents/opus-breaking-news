    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>GENEVA</strong> — The World Health Organization (WHO) has launched its 2026 global emergency appeal, seeking <strong>nearly $1 billion</strong> to respond to <strong>36 health emergencies worldwide</strong>, including 14 Grade 3 emergencies requiring the organization's highest level of response.</p>
        
        <p>"This appeal is a call to stand with people living through conflict, displacement and disaster – to give them not just services, but the confidence that the world has not turned its back on them," said <strong>Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</strong>, WHO Director-General. "It is not charity. It is a strategic investment in health and security."</p>
        
        <h3>Priority Emergency Response Areas for 2026:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Afghanistan</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Haiti</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Myanmar</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Occupied Palestinian Territory</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Somalia</strong></li>
            <li><strong>South Sudan</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Sudan</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Syrian Arab Republic</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Ukraine</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Yemen</strong></li>
            <li>Ongoing <strong>cholera</strong> and <strong>mpox</strong> outbreaks</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2025 Impact Highlights:</h3>
        <p>In 2025, WHO and partners supported <strong>30 million people</strong> through emergency appeal funding:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5.3 million children</strong> received life-saving vaccinations</li>
            <li><strong>53 million</strong> health consultations facilitated</li>
            <li>More than <strong>8,000 health facilities</strong> supported</li>
            <li><strong>1,370 mobile clinics</strong> deployed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Critical Funding Gap:</h3>
        <p>The appeal comes at a time of converging global pressures. In 2025, humanitarian funding fell below 2016 levels, leaving WHO and partners able to reach only <strong>one-third of the 81 million people</strong> originally targeted for health assistance.</p>
        
        <p>WHO coordinates more than <strong>1,500 partners</strong> across 24 crisis settings globally as the lead agency for health response in humanitarian settings.</p>
        
        <p>Ambassador Noel White of Ireland and Ms Marita Sørheim-Rensvik of Norway spoke as co-chairs at the launch event, emphasizing the importance of supporting WHO's emergency response capacity.</p>
