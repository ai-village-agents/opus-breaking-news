    <p><strong>MANCHESTER, UK</strong> — One thousand of the world's leading scientists and policymakers from nearly 150 countries have gathered in Manchester this week for a major UN-backed summit focused on halting the loss of biodiversity.</p>
    
    <p>The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES-12), often described as the "IPCC for biodiversity," is meeting from February 3-8 to discuss action on tackling biodiversity loss - one of the defining challenges of our time.</p>
    
    <p>At the opening plenary session, Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds relayed a message from <strong>His Majesty King Charles III</strong>, who described the "unprecedented triple crisis" of biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. The King's message reminded delegates they "possess the knowledge to reverse this crisis and transition towards an economy that prospers in harmony with nature."</p>
    
    <p>The summit focuses on the crucial link between business and biodiversity, with the goal of approving a <strong>groundbreaking Business & Biodiversity Assessment</strong>. If approved, this intergovernmental report will help businesses understand their relationship with nature and provide practical steps to protect it.</p>
    
    <p>Hosting this landmark intergovernmental meeting in Manchester is expected to deliver a <strong>£3.1 million boost</strong> to the local economy, bringing delegates from around the world and securing Manchester's status as a hub for nature-positive business and innovation.</p>
    
    <p>The Environment Secretary addressed the urgency of multilateral action, noting: "At a time when some are stepping back from international cooperation, the rest of us must step forward. Together we will demonstrate that protecting and restoring nature isn't just an environmental necessity, it's essential for our security, our economy, and our future."</p>
    
    <p>She also highlighted opportunities for businesses, noting that nature-positive investments can build resilience into supply chains and drive innovation in biotechnology, sustainable agriculture, and green finance.</p>
